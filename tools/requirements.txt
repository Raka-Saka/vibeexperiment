# Requirements for genre classifier training
# IMPORTANT: Use TensorFlow 2.14.x or 2.15.x for TFLite model compatibility
# TensorFlow 2.16+ produces FULLY_CONNECTED op v12 which isn't supported
# by Android TFLite runtime

# Option 1: TensorFlow 2.14.0 (recommended - best compatibility)
tensorflow==2.14.0

# Core dependencies
tensorflow-hub>=0.15.0
numpy>=1.24.0
soundfile>=0.12.0

# For GTZAN dataset from Hugging Face
datasets>=2.14.0
